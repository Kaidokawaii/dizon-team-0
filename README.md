[hello world](https://google.com)

Hi, my name is Ethan. I will be doing part A of milestone 1.





______________
My name is Ethan McFadden. I am excited to learn new stuff for this project and have some ideas in varying levels of difficulty.

1: The left of the screen has a cliff, and particles representing water will flow off the cliff into a hole at the bottom, filling up as the waterfall continues flowing (Expected Least Difficulty)

2: The bottom of the screen has a floor a few layers deep. Clicking the sreen above the floor will make a bomb appear, which will fall with gravity and explode into particles when it hits the ground, destroying some of the ground with it (Expected Medium Difficulty)

3: clicking the screen at will make a bunch of particles appear around the clicked spot, which implode into an image, like the example we saw in class. This will then fall to the bottom of the screen once the image is formed, at which point it explodes into particles again (Expected Most Difficulty)

Hi, my name is Quennel Kempe. I was here.

My idea for the particle system was having asteroids fall down to the terrain by the use of gravity, and when they dropped, they exploded. When two asteroids collide they change into another color (black, gray, red, orange, purple). When multiple asteroids land at the same time, there is a bigger radius of the explosion.

Hi my name is Khai, I was here and created the README 

I wanted to try making a particle system where we have multiple colored particles flying around the screen and if they collide, depending on the color, the particle will "eat" or change the particle of what its colliding with, and we can see almost all the paticles slowly change into one dominant color.
