My name is Ethan McFadden. I am excited to learn new stuff for this project and have some ideas in varying levels of difficulty.

1: The left of the screen has a cliff, and particles representing water will flow off the cliff into a hole at the bottom, filling up as the waterfall continues flowing (Expected Least Difficulty)

2: The bottom of the screen has a floor a few layers deep. Clicking the sreen above the floor will make a bomb appear, which will fall with gravity and explode into particles when it hits the ground, destroying some of the ground with it (Expected Medium Difficulty)

3: clicking the screen at will make a bunch of particles appear around the clicked spot, which implode into an image, like the example we saw in class. This will then fall to the bottom of the screen once the image is formed, at which point it explodes into particles again (Expected Most Difficulty)
